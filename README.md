Imgee
=====

Imgee saves files to S3 under a app/user/file path and lets other applications
retrieve the image via a lastuser resource.

Imgee uses Compass for custom stylesheets. Stylesheets are located
in `imgee/static/sass` and may be rebuilt with `compass compile`. To rebuild
automatically, use `compass watch`.
